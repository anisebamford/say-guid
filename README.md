## WHAT IT DO
It turns your impossible to read bog standard guid into something fun and
possible to pronounce. If that's too much fun, it can change them back again.

I mean, what's more fun?

or
 didzipkel-lubnag-pifdef-fodfuf-tawmikfuy?

## HOW IT DO
Basically converts base 16 to base sixteen hundred thirty something, then picks 
twelve correlating syllables out of a list. I've gotten rid of a lot of the 
fun ones, and attempted to disallow syllables that were too similar so that
the words are a little bit reasonable.

## WHY THO?
Because. Guids suck.

## CAN I ...?
Yes.
